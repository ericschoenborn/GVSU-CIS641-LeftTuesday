Team name: LeftTuesday

Team members: Eric Schoenborn

# Introduction

LeftTuesday will eventually be a fully functional task planning system built around user ease.
For this class I will be fucusing on the backend.
Goals for the end of the semester will be to have a API that allows elevated users to created tasks with the
abbility to add time contraints. At the same time the LeftTuesday API will allow non-elevated users to view these
tasks and see their progress. Finally there will be a mid-elevated user that will be able to track the non-elevated
users progress.

The easies way to view this would be the Project manager -> Supervisor -> worker relation, but please remember, 
LeftTuesday is so much more.

# Anticipated Technologies

* C#
# DotNet Core 5
# Data store (tbd)
# might add a frontend

# Method/Approach

The project is going full agile. The reasoning is that functional parts will be added one at a time in a develop to feature pipeline.
Whith this aproach, the project should be more resistance to changes.

# Estimated Timeline

## Short term (one week)
Create a pingable api that renturns and echo

## Mid term (three weeks)
* Full list of needed endpoints
* Well definded DDD modedes and a sound understanding of their relations
* Some fully funcitoning endpoints
* Data storage plan

## Long term
Have a completed project

# Anticipated Problems

* Data storage: videos take up a lot of space
* Rights and privacey of those demoing for the videos
* Front end?
