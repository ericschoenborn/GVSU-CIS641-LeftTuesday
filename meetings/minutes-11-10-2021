Discussion points:

*Alot happend, like a whole lot
*this is meeting covers more then one week
*data store set up and C# code to ensure tables exist exist
*new object is needed called Session. It has been decided that a concept should be a re-usesable item
 to achive this a session is the "living" instance of a Concept. Think of it as a geometry math class.
 "Geometry" is the Concept and "Fall 2021" is the Session
*Concept Manager is now a user with limited editing access to a Concept
*New Object SessionLeader takes over the left over access from former Concept Manager
*Concept no longer has Participants. Rather a Session has a 1:1 relation with a Concept and 1:m relation with participants

Goals for next week (include responsibilities)

- Keep on keeping on
- object validation
- maybe get to permissions
